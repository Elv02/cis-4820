| Compilation Instructions |
|==========================|

The provided makefile is setup for Linux Libraries by default. The
path for MACOS are also provided but is commented out.

To compile the program use the makefile by executing the 'make' command
while in the directory containing 'makefile'.  This will generate an 
executable called 'a1'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If using another Makefile that is not the provided one,
you *must* be sure to include the maze.c and perlin.c in addition to the a1.c,
graphics.c and visible.c files when running gcc!

| Execution Instructions |
|========================|   

To run the program use '/a2'.  Optionally you may use the '-help' flag
to see a list of available commands.

| Important Implementation Notes |
|================================|

1) The player will always spawn above ground within 5 blocks of the stairs block leading
into the dungeon.

2) The bonus feature of being able to go through doors is still in this version.
I even track which doors have been opened between floor changes.

3) Even though the outline only specified one above ground level and one underground level,
I have implemented a stack-based system for generating/storing floors of the game.  In theory you can
go very, very far down.

4) I was unsure if stairs were supposed to be 'flush' with the ground, so I opted to make them pop above ground like
boxes to make them easier to find.
