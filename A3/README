| Compilation Instructions |
|==========================|

The provided makefile is setup for Linux Libraries by default. The
path for MACOS are also provided but is commented out.

To compile the program use the makefile by executing the 'make' command
while in the directory containing 'makefile'.  This will generate an 
executable called 'a1'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If using another Makefile that is not the provided one,
you *must* be sure to include the maze.c, and perlin.c in addition to the a1.c,
graphics.c, mesh.c and visible.c files when running gcc!

| Execution Instructions |
|========================|   

To run the program use '/a1'.  Optionally you may use the '-help' flag
to see a list of available commands.

| New Implementation Notes |
|==========================|

1) Enemies will always stay in the room they've been spawned in initially.   However do note they can stumble into the hallways once a door has been opened.

2) To aid in illustrating if an enemy is being rendered or not, I change the colour of the enemy from purple to pink 
   on the radar when they are currently being rendered.  (This is in addition to the console output)

| Old Implementation Reminders |
|==============================|

1) The player will always spawn above ground within 5 blocks of the stairs block leading
into the dungeon.

2) The bonus feature of being able to open doors is still in this version.
