| Compilation Instructions |
|==========================|

The provided makefile is setup for Linux Libraries by default. The
path for MACOS are also provided but is commented out.

To compile the program use the makefile by executing the 'make' command
while in the directory containing 'makefile'.  This will generate an 
executable called 'a1'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If using another Makefile that is not the provided one,
you *must* be sure to include the maze.c, and perlin.c in addition to the a1.c,
graphics.c, mesh.c and visible.c files when running gcc!

| Execution Instructions |
|========================|   

To run the program use '/a1'.  Optionally you may use the '-help' flag
to see a list of available commands.

| New Implementation Notes |
|==========================|

1) Mobs pathfind using the A* algorithm; and should therefore not get stuck on any level geometry/entities.

2) Mobs that are aggro'd or wandering the level (bats) will open doors to get to their targets.

3) When in "Full Map" mode (not Fog-of-War) enemy paths will be drawn on the map to show they are pathing toward their targets.

| Mob Colours |
|=============|

Mobs have the following colours assigned on the map:
Red -> Bat (Random Search)
Purple -> Fish (Responsive)
Pink -> Cactus (Plant)

Lighter, more translucent variations of these colours are used to highlight current paths in full map mode.

| Old Implementation Reminders |
|==============================|

1) The player will always spawn above ground within 5 blocks of the stairs block leading
into the dungeon.

2) The bonus feature of being able to open doors is still in this version.

| Minor Issues |
|==============|

1) Due to the complexity of the program very rare crashes have been know to occur.  While you should not encounter any on use as I have made every effort to stamp out
   all bugs; I would implore you to try running it one more time in the event a crash does happen.

2) Mobs rotate when moving/attacking, but I did not match up some of the meshes to rotate... correctly.  Will likely fix for final (A5)
