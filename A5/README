| Compilation Instructions |
|==========================|

The provided makefile is setup for Linux Libraries by default. The
path for MACOS are also provided but is commented out.

To compile the program use the makefile by executing the 'make' command
while in the directory containing 'makefile'.  This will generate an 
executable called 'a1'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If using another Makefile that is not the provided one,
you *must* be sure to include the maze.c, and perlin.c in addition to the a1.c,
graphics.c, mesh.c and visible.c files when running gcc!

| Execution Instructions |
|========================|   

To run the program use '/a1'.  Optionally you may use the '-help' flag
to see a list of available commands.

| Mob Colours |
|=============|

Mobs have the following colours assigned on the map:
Red -> Bat (Random Search)
Purple -> Fish (Responsive)
Pink -> Cactus (Plant)

| Item Colours |
|==============|

Cyan -> Bow
Gold -> Key

| Implementation Notes |
|======================|

1) Tossing arrows (Random Rotation) at mobs is a feature, not a bug.

2) The Bow can be found on every dungeon floor.

3) The crates have been cleared from the minimap to make identifying mobs/items easier.

4) The floors are still infinite (despite the 5 floor outline), but follow the pattern outlined:
   Floor 0     -> Outside
   Odd Floors  -> Dungeon
   Even Floors -> Cave

| Minor Issues |
|==============|

1) Sliding against walls has been implemented, but I've noticed that the player can clip slightly inside of obtuse angle corners now (i.e. near doorways).
   I have unfortunately been unable to find a remedy for this.

2) Due to the complexity of the program very rare crashes have been know to occur.  While you should not encounter any on use as I have made every effort to stamp out
   all bugs; I would implore you to try running it one more time in the event a crash does happen.
