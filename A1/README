| Compilation Instructions |
|==========================|

To compile the program use the makefile by executing the 'make' command
while in the directory containing 'makefile'.  This will generate an 
executable called 'a1'.

| Execution Instructions |
|========================|   

To run the program use '/a1'.  Optionally you may use the '-help' flag
to see a list of available commands.

| Important Implementation Notes |
|================================|

1) There is a bonus feature I have implemented into this program that is not in
the outline.  If you approach the orange 'doors' at the edge of a room they
will open when you touch them.  This allows the player to better track where
they have been so far in the maze and what doors they have/have not entered.

2) The player spawns atop a 'player' model (generated from the provided
"createPlayer" function) which I have left in as a marker to show the players
starting point. 

3) There is one note to make regarding the collision detection in this program.
While I make a sincere effort to predict and mitigate collisions that put 
the player's view within world geometry, it *is* still possible to enter
world geometry if you are determined enough and approach a wall at a fairly
small angle (parallel to the wall).

I spoke with the professor during lecture time about this issue, and he was
of the opinion that this should solution should still be sufficient enough
to count as "preventing the view from entering world geometry".
